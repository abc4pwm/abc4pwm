# demo for motif finding from RNA-seq dataset:
1. set demo fold under the directory of bayesI2
2. the data_in fold contains of an expression file (differentially expressed genes, DEGs, from RNA-seq) and an sequence file. The DEGs fold change (FC) in log2 scale.
3. run script by:  bash script_motifFind_RNAseq.sh
