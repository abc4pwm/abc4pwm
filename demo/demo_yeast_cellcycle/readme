README FOR YEAST CELL CYCLE DEMO


Runs demo on 3 stages of yeast cell cycle -> Alpha7, alpha42, alpha49
Cell cycle data is sourced by the following paper: http://genome-www.stanford.edu/cellcycle/

******** What is in data sets ********
Micro array expression data is acquired from : http://genome-www.stanford.edu/cellcycle/data/rawdata/


filtered and clean input data for yeast cell cycle: yeast_in/

Reference PWMs for 9 cell cycle regulating TES : SGD_yeast_cellCycle/

Output for bayespi2 and input for abc4pwm: yeast_out/

output for abc4pwm: yeast_abc4pwm_out/


******** How to run demo ********

Run following bash scripts to run the demo:

1) To run bayespi (will automatically run for strand0 and then strand1):

./demo_bsh_bayespi

(See log files for console out put e.g. out.log.s0.alpha7)

2) To run abc4pwm:

./demo_bsh_abc4pwm_s0.sh (for strand0)
./demo_bsh_abc4pwm_s1.sh (for strand1)
